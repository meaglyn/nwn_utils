# Configuration file for NWN Utils
#
# This should be copied to tool_cfg (dropping the .in) in the scripts directory 
# of the NWN Utils tree. 
#
# This system requires the installation of several other components. 
# The easiest way to do this is to put the varias binaries and ruby scripts in 
# this directory  and expand the include files in the parent. 
# Requirements:
#
# nwn-lib ruby gem and ruby. Put the nwn-gff script in here or update the path
#
# nwnnsscomp script compiler from Meaglyn's nwn-tools repo built and installed here or path updated
#
# unpacked archive of nwscript include files from all NWN releases and optionally cpp1.71. In parent 
# directory or path updated.
#
# Erf utility (from this repo) built and installed here (or path updated...)
#
# nwntlkcomp TLK file compiler, built and installed here (or path updated...)
